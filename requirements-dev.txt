# Development-only Dependencies
# Currently all dev dependencies are in requirements.txt for simplicity
# This file is a placeholder for future dev-specific tools like:
# - Type checkers (mypy)
# - Linters (ruff, flake8)
# - Code formatters (black)
# - Documentation generators (sphinx)

# To install dev dependencies in the future:
# pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
